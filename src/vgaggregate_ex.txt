The aggregations I applied to the data are:

● Separating data into two tables: aggregating average critic score for shooter games and aggregating average critic score for sports games.
● Sourcing min, max, and average for critic scores for all games, shooter games, and sports games.
● Separating data into two (more) tables: aggregating global sales for shooter games and aggregating global sales for sports games.

The code used and the screencaps of the result are available in the .docx file.
