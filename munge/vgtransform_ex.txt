The transformations I applied to the data were:

Creating a table that was genre, global_sales, and critic_score.
Rounding the global_sales data to whole numbers.
Filtering out all critic_score data less than/equal to 0.
Organising the critic_score data column from highest to lowest.

The code used and the screencaps of the result are available in the .docx file.
